Repo for my MSc Computing and Information Systems project
This folder contains:

main.py - where the bot is run from
Procfile - for heroku deployment
.env - environment variables
requirements.txt - for heroku deployment
runtime.txt - for heroku deployment
user_messages.txt - file used to store user messages before db was set up

N.B if replicating this project you will need a .env file that stores your slack token and signing secret
