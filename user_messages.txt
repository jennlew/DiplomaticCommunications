I think we need to be more conscious about how much time we are spending in meetings and also the agenda, and action items discussed within them. Too much time is being spent talking and not enough actual decisions or actions or being captured. Often we are going round in circles discussing the same points or continuously introducing new requirements that were not previously discussed.
